From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

skipping this project for now. i feel like i'll learn more efficiently when i do the more advanced stuff in the later course anyway. i might come back to this if i have no idea what i'm doing then, but for now i want to move on to learning javascript.
